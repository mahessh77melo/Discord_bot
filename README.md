# The Movie Nerd

This is the first Discord Bot that I created. This is a by product of my [hulu-clone](https://github.com/mahessh77melo/hulu-clone). I have used the same TMDB API that I had used for my previous web app. 
This bot is done using **Node.js** and the **discord.js** libraries. 
The tag of the bot is **theMovieNerd#6877**.

Commands :
- The bot command starter is set to `!`.
- As of now, the bot is capable of giving info about the movies or tv shows when asked for it.
- `!movie shawshank redemption` for a movie and `!tv peaky blinders` for shows.
- It also has a cute greet message when u send a *hey*.
- The bot is capable of politely responding to irrelevant commands and invalid movie names.

Any help from a fellow developer is appreciated! 
Fork my repo and submit a pull request from your own branch if you can suggest me a suitable feature for this bot.


Also feel free to use this bot on your server as this is a public one. 
You can contact me via Discord **kingJames#2472**.

Thanks for giving a read :)
