# The Movie Nerd

This is the first Discord Bot that I created. This is a by product of my [hulu-clone](https://github.com/mahessh77melo/hulu-clone). I have used the same TMDB API that I had used for my previous web app. 
This bot is done using **Node.js** and the **discord.js** libraries. 
The tag of the bot is **theMovieNerd#6877**.

Commands :
- The bot command starter is set to `!`.
- As of now, the bot is capable of giving info about the movies or tv shows and giving out random quotes.
- `!movie shawshank redemption` for a movie and `!tv peaky blinders` for shows.
- `!wrong` if the movie or show that you got as a result wasn't the one you searched for, this is for further interaction.
- `!${number}` when asked for your choice when the other results are shown to you, this is to be done after giving the `!wrong` command.
- `!list` if you want to explore the other results.
- `!BrBa` for a random Breaking Bad quote.
- `!got` for a random Game of thrones quote.
- `line` for a random movie quote.
- It also has a cute greet message when u send a *hey*.
- The bot is capable of politely responding to irrelevant commands and invalid movie names.
